# Recommendation Engine with Python
Creating a recommendation system with Python using Movie Lens Data Set.

## Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of usersâ€™ attitude to items, that is it uses the "wisdom of the crowd" to recommend items. 

In general, Collaborative filtering (CF) is more commonly used than content-based systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation perspective). The algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use. 

CF can be divided into **Memory-Based Collaborative Filtering** and **Model-Based Collaborative filtering**. 

Here, I will implement Model-Based CF by using singular value decomposition (SVD) and Memory-Based CF by computing cosine similarity. 

## The Data

We will use famous MovieLens dataset, which is one of the most common datasets used when implementing and testing recommender engines. It contains 100k movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies.

You can download the dataset [here](http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip) or just use the u.data file that is already included in this folder.
